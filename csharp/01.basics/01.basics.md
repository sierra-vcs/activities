# CS.1.001 
## Quick Bill from Two Readings



Problem
-------

Write a console app that:

*   Prompts for meterSerial (string), prevReading (int), currReading (int).
    
*   Computes units = currReading - prevReading.
    
*   If units ≤ 0, print an error.
    
*   Else compute energyCharge = units \* 6.5 and a tax = 5% and total = energyCharge + tax.
    
*   Print a one-line bill summary.
    

Guidance
--------

*   Use string, int, double.
    
*   Use arithmetic operators and an if/else guard.
    
*   Format to 2 decimals with ToString("F2").
    

Sample Input
------------

```c#
meterSerial = "AP-000123"  
prevReading = 12500  
currReading = 12620   `
````
Expected Output
---------------

```
Meter AP-000123 | Units: 120 | Energy: ₹780.00 | Tax(5%): ₹39.00 | Total: ₹819.00   `
```
Stretch
-------

*   Add validation: reject negative readings.
    
*   If units > 500, print “High usage alert”.
    

Evaluation
----------

## Weekly Consumption Basics

Problem
-------

Given **7 daily kWh values** for a meter, compute:

*   Total, average
    
*   Day index (1-based) of **max** usage
    
*   Number of **outage** days (value == 0)
    

Print all on one line.

Guidance
--------

*   Use an int\[\] daily hardcoded.
    
*   Use a for loop, if to count outages, track max and index.
    

Starter Data
------------

int[] daily = { 4, 5, 6, 0, 7, 8, 5 };
```

Expected Output
---------------

*   Total = 35
    
*   Average = 5.00
    
*   Max = 8 on Day 6
    
*   Outages = 1
    

**One possible print:**

`
Total: 35 kWh | Avg: 5.00 kWh | Max: 8 kWh (Day 6) | Outages: 1   
`

Stretch

# CS.2.003
## Parse Load Profile Lines (No Files)


Problem
-------

You’re given **7 CSV-like lines**: yyyy-MM-dd,kWh,status where status is OK / OUTAGE / TAMPER.Compute:

*   Sum of kWh where status == OK
    
*   Count of OUTAGE days
    
*   Count of TAMPER days
    
*   Average kWh across only OK days
    

Guidance
--------

*   Use string\[\] lines.
    
*   For each line: Split(','), double.Parse, if/else if.
    
*   Keep okCount to compute average.
    

Starter Data
------------

```c#
string[] lines = {    "2025-09-01,4.2,OK",    "2025-09-02,5.0,OK",    "2025-09-03,0.0,OUTAGE",    "2025-09-04,3.8,OK",    "2025-09-05,6.1,OK",    "2025-09-06,2.5,TAMPER",    "2025-09-07,5.4,OK"  };   `
```
Expected Output (deterministic)
-------------------------------

*   OK sum = **24.5 kWh**
    
*   OUTAGE days = **1**
    
*   TAMPER days = **1**
    
*   OK average = **4.90 kWh**
    

**Example print:**

`   OK: 24.50 kWh (avg 4.90) | OUTAGE: 1 | TAMPER: 1   `

# CS.3.004
## Multi-Meter Weekly Health Report


Problem
-------

For **3 meters**, each with 7 daily kWh entries:

*   For each meter:
    
    *   Total & average
        
    *   PeakAlert if any day > 8 kWh
        
    *   SustainedOutage if there are **two consecutive** zero-days
        
*   Across all meters, find the **single highest day usage** (value + which meter + day)
    

Guidance
--------

*   Use int\[\]\[\] meters as a **jagged array**.
    
*   Outer loop over meters, inner over days.
    
*   Use flags for alerts; track per-meter max and global max (with meter/day indexes).
    

Starter Data
------------

```c#   
int[][] meters = new int[][]  {    
    new[] { 4, 5, 0, 0, 6, 7, 3 }, // A    
    new[] { 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 }, // B    
    new[] { 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 }  // C  
};  
    string[] ids = { "A-1001", "B-2001", "C-3001" };  
// 
```

Expected Per-Meter Stats
------------------------

# CS.3.005
## Monthly Slab Billing with Category & Outage Check

Problem
-------

Simulate a **30-day** month for one meter:

*   You’re given a 10-day pattern of daily units; repeat it 3× to make 30 days.
    
*   Compute:
    
    *   monthlyUnits (sum)
        
    *   outageDays (entries equal to 0)
        
*   Compute energy charge using slabs:
    
    *   First **100** units @ ₹**4.0**
        
    *   Next **200** units @ ₹**6.0**
        
    *   Remaining @ ₹**8.5**
        
*   Add fixed charge by category (use a variable):
    
    *   DOMESTIC → ₹**50**
        
    *   COMMERCIAL → ₹**150**
        
*   If outageDays == 0, apply **2% rebate** on (energy + fixed); otherwise no rebate.
    
*   Print a tidy invoice line with the breakdown.
    

Guidance
--------

*   Build int\[\] pattern then create int\[\] month = new int\[30\] with loops.
    
*   Use a switch on category string.
    
*   Compute slabs with arithmetic + if/else if.
    
*   Keep all money as double.
    

Starter Data
------------
```c#   
int[] pattern = { 4, 4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5 }; // sum = 43  
string category = "COMMERCIAL"; // change to test   `
```

**Note:** Repeating pattern 3× ⇒ monthlyUnits = **43 × 3 = 129**, outageDays = **3**.

### Slab Calculation for 129 units

*   First 100 @ 4.0 = **₹400**
    
*   Next 29 @ 6.0 = **₹174**
    
*   Total energy = **₹574**
    
*   Fixed (COMMERCIAL) = **₹150**
    
*   Outages > 0 ⇒ **no rebate**
    
*   **Grand Total = ₹724.00**
    

Expected Output
---------------
`
Category: COMMERCIAL | Units: 129 | Energy: ₹574.00 | Fixed: ₹150.00 | Rebate: ₹0.00 | Total: ₹724.00 | Outages: 3   `

Stretch
-------

*   Print a **slab-wise** line-item table.
    
*   Try DOMESTIC and confirm rebate triggers only when outageDays == 0.
    

Evaluation
----------

*   Correct 30-day construction via loops
    
*   Accurate slab math & category handling
    
*   Proper conditional rebate logic

### **Problem**

Write a console app that:

*   Reads previous and current readings (in kWh).
    
*   Calculates the difference (consumption).
    
*   Checks:
    
    *   If consumption < 0 → Invalid.
        
    *   If consumption == 0 → Possible outage.
        
    *   If consumption > 500 → High consumption alert.
        

### **Use Concepts**

*   Arithmetic operators (+, -)
    
*   Comparison operators (<, ==, >)
    
*   Logical operators (&&, ||)
    
*   if statements
    

### **Sample Input**

`   Previous Reading: 15000  Current Reading: 15620   `

### **Expected Output**

`   Net Consumption: 620 kWh  High Consumption Alert!   `

### **Stretch**

Add logical condition: if consumption > 100 and < 500 → print “Normal usage”.

# CS.2.007
## Meter Category-based Tariff using switch


### **Problem**

Given a meterCategory ("DOMESTIC", "COMMERCIAL", "AGRICULTURE"):

*   Use switch to assign rate:
    
    *   DOMESTIC → ₹6.0/unit
        
    *   COMMERCIAL → ₹8.5/unit
        
    *   AGRICULTURE → ₹3.0/unit
        
*   Calculate total bill for given units.
    

### **Use Concepts**

*   switch
    
*   Arithmetic + assignment
    
*   String comparison
    

### **Sample Input**
`   meterCategory = "COMMERCIAL"  units = 120   `

### **Expected Output**

`   Category: COMMERCIAL | Rate: ₹8.5 | Total Bill: ₹1020.00   `

### **Stretch**

Add a default case → “Unknown category. Check configuration.”

### **Stretch**

Print message:

`   Performance Status: Stable / Unstable   `

(where _Stable_ = outageDays ≤ 1 and peakDays ≤ 2)

<br>

# CS.3.009
## Analyze Tamper & Outage Patterns

### **Problem**

Simulate meter status logs for a week:Each day record:Status = "OK", "OUTAGE", "TAMPER", "LOW\_VOLT".

Write a loop:

*   Count how many times each event occurs.
    
*   If outage count > 2 OR tamper count > 1 → print “Maintenance required”.
    
*   Else print “Meter healthy”.
    

### **Use Concepts**

*   foreach
    
*   Logical OR (||) and AND (&&)
    
*   Nested conditionals
    

### **Sample Data**

L`   string[] status = { "OK", "OUTAGE", "OK", "TAMPER", "OUTAGE", "OK", "LOW_VOLT" };   `

### **Expected Output**

`   OK: 3 | OUTAGE: 2 | TAMPER: 1 | LOW_VOLT: 1  Meter healthy   `

### **Stretch**

Add “Suspicious Pattern” if tamper occurs right after an outage.
